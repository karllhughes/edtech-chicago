# Edtech Chicago
A list of resources for people interested in working in education technology in Chicago.

## Why?
I speak at a lot of bootcamps and meetups, and one of the most common questions I get is, "How can I get into edtech in Chicago?" This repository is my long answer to that question.

## Companies
If you want to work in edtech, you need to know which employers are out there and what they're doing. Here are some ways you can search for education technology companies:

- [Search for edtech and education companies in Chicago on Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/bca43c7aab64be6e1e27101fd1385e581d148083)
- [Built in Chicago's Edtech Company List](https://www.builtinchicago.org/guides/edtech-chicago)
- [Education Jobs on Angelist](https://angel.co/chicago/education/jobs)

## Meetups
So far I've only found one meetup explicity focused on edtech, but lots of startup meetups have edtech events, so keep an eye on these resources:

- [Edtech Chicago Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/EdTech-Chicago/) organized by eSpark Learning
- [Technori pitch showcase](http://technori.com/events/)
- [Events at 1871](https://1871.com/events/)
- [Chicago Tech Events](http://chicagotechevents.com/)
- [Built in Chicago Events](https://www.builtinchicago.org/events)

## Open Source
One of the best ways to set yourself apart as a new developer is to contribute to an existing open source project. Here are a few I've found in edtech:

- [Canvas](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms) - A learning management system written in Ruby on Rails.
- [Moodle](https://github.com/moodle/moodle) - A learning management system written in PHP
- [Rubric Creator](https://github.com/thegraidenetwork/rubric-creator) - A rubric creation tool for building and sharing scoring rubrics written in Angular and Typescript.
- [Student Insights](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights) - A student grade data platform for teachers and administrators written in Ruby on Rails.

## Other
Here are things I haven't worked into another category yet.

- [Teach100 - Top education blogs](https://teach.com/what/teachers-know/teach100/) - This is a huge list of education and edtech blogs. Follow some of the top ones to keep up with trends and new innovation in the industry.
- [My list of 1000 education blogs](https://airtable.com/shrJSchmy4BHHadEA) - I curated this list with the intent of building a huge education news aggregator...which I haven't gotten around to yet.

Feel free to suggest your own resources, blog posts, meetups, open source projects, or whatever!
